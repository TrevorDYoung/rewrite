Purpose:
	[X]Allow user to edit a paragraph in a way that microsoft word actually does not provide.
	[X]Automate rewriting process.
	[X]Must take the least amount of time away from the creative process as possible.
	
Definitions:
	Rewrite: The process of going through my rough draft and rewriting each sentence 5 times and picking the best one. One by one for each sentence. Including outlining the sentence context, idea, and functional purpose.

Problem: 
	I'm too lazy to rewrite my sentences as writing in MS word.
	Rewriting in word can sometimes mess up surrounding sentences.
	Rewriting in word is messy and can sometimes mess with surrounding sentences.
	Rewriting is time-consuming with tables, comments, basically all the attempted methods in word.
	
Requirments:
	[X]Must accept entire paragraphs and parse out each sentence. Working on each one at a time.
	[X]Must display all rewrites and paragraph.
	[X]As you pick different rewrites from the list, the paragraph updates.
	[X]Rewrites must allow 20 indexes. Or make it a vector.
	[X]Implement the delete rewrite function.
	
Bugs:
	[X]Fix the work around on rewrite list. Currently limits the user to 10 rewrites and will go out of bounds.
	[X]Check user input does not go out ob bounds for rewrite.
	[X]Loading breaks when the user doesn't end a sentence with punctuation. This is due to the missmatch sentence objects to rewrites in the save file.
		-Potentail fix. In the add rewrite function under Sentence class, check if the argument ends in punctuation. If not, append a period at the end.
	
Ideas:
	Menu driven, function that accepts menu options.
		Variables:
			arr[MAX_SENTENCES] paragraph //paragraph is an object
		
		Functions:
			deleteRewrite //get rewrite; return int selection;
			editRewrite //WIBNI
			nextSentence
			lastSentence
		
	Each sentence is an object. They can all be shoved in an array in main.
		Attributes:
			String content
			vector rewrites //Too many index related operations to use array. Delete being the most messy.
		
		Functions:
			get rewrites
			add rewrite
			insertSelectedRewrite //this.content = selection
			deleteRewrite (int selection) //Only called in main function with maching name.

OutPut:
	Paste paragraph to rewrite: 
	
	-------------------------------Paragraph-------------------------------
	*Display Paragraph highlight sentence being operated on somehow.*
	-------------------------------Rewrites-------------------------------
	*List of rewrites with index values as menu options.*
	-------------------------------Menu-------------------------------
	Type a sentence to add a rewrite. Numbers will insert corrisponding rewrite.
	A) Go to next sentence.
	B) Go to previous sentence.
	C) Delete rewrite. //runs deleteRewrite
	D) Edit rewrite. //WIBNI
	E) Finished.
	
	-------------------------------Finished Paragraph-------------------------------
	
	-------------------------------Finished Paragraph-------------------------------
	Paste paragraph to rewrite:
	
Very High Priority(!!) High Priority(!) Normal Priority (NULL) Low Priority (zzz) Very Low Priority (Zzz) Should I Even bother? (???)
	[X]		Didnt display empty strings in paragraph
	[X]		Better formatting on the displayed paragraph
	[X]		Add to sentence a string variable named sentenceIdea. Here the user can store the goal of the sentence.
	[X](!!)	Insert a new sentence and move the rest in front up one. Could use a series of swaps to do this. Or just use a vector.
	[X](!)  Saving and loading from a file. Option to paste or load.
	[X](!!) When you select finished, it needs to print out a copy paste friendly version of the paragraph. Remove new lines. 
	[X](!!) Insert a space at the start of every rewrite.
	[X](!) 	Display the menu options in a grid.
	[X](!!)	Load the saved rewrites.
	[X](zzz) Program runs with the assumption that paragraphs dont normally have over 30 sentences. More than enough.
	[X](!) 	Add idea string to swap function.
	[X](!) 	Add idea string to the clear fucntion.
	[](Zzz)	Edit rewrite. Will be easier to impliment proper when program is GUI.
	[](???) Option to save more than one file.
	[](!)	Fancy GUI.

# rewrite
Definitions

Rewrite: List of sentences used to replace a single sentence in a piece of writing. For each sentence, the user creates multiple rewrites, each of which is stored in   a list. Once the user has finished adding rewrites, they pick the one they like the best, and it is inserted into the document. Replacing the original sentence. 

Prototype: Works on a paragraph one sentence at a time allowing the user to store rewrites for each sentence in the command line.

About

Rewrite is a simple text editing application that aims to assist writers in the final step of the writing process. It allows the user to rewrite each sentence and stores each rewrite for said sentence in a list. The user can then select one of said rewrites and see it inserted into thier work, replacing the original sentence. This is the main goal of the program and it is meant to be used as the final editing process of writing. It is meant to be used in tandem with your favorite text editing software rather than replace it.

For now, I only have a prototype that runs in the command line, after finding the prototype useful, I decided it's time to learn how to make it user friendly.
